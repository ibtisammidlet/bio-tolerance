i get this tendency, cant sleep
cutting out like surgery 
will my circuits bleed
kiss me, i step over leaves
blood moon over me, i cant retreat
its like my mind's waking up 
but my body needs to sleeeeep

im so tired, im so weak
lost my soul, im bleeding out
please let me go to sleep
cause you know what's best for me
when the shadows dance im free
curse the pixies, burn the trees
forest walk, hear the banshee scream
call of death, i know that's what i need
