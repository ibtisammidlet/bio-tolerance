its getting sunny
but i dont feel that inside
ive been dreaming of a pure life
the world's a beauty
but its hurting me sometimes
lets go do what you like
i think im dreaming of an early grave tonight
like a moth to a blue light
got a blade on me, my blood is so bright
bleeding dark under blue skies
cant live without you, im still underated
i turn our bed to a gravesite
cast a shadow over sigils painted white
bleeding out, this is suicide
