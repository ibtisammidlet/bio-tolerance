6:43 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: in wanting to become a lawyer is a state of a lawyer to become through process of some things overcome itself from being someone not a lawyer but some things that to become a lawyer someone is not therefore it's a killing of what you would not choose to become instead and becoming of what you chose to become
[6:44 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: in fact most things that someone could be are killed in the process of becoming from some things a someone that is not some things that they could not be at the same time
[6:45 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: like in thinking about getting a haircut you choose one thing it is to become and almost an infinite amount of possibilities are killed off
[6:45 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: in fact choice in this way reveals how narrowly we see just how much choice we can have there are so many things we can choose it's ridiculous
[6:46 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: so that explains why the being desires always to become more aware itself to become someone with more desires
[6:46 AM] Occultare: :thinking:
[6:48 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: but you are not for example truly aware of some things you are because the being wants to become of more things than it is for example you don't think of having legs until you think about them and then you feel the more acutely
[6:48 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: so you are always escaping someone you are to be more of some things to become someone you are not
[6:48 AM] Occultare: selective awareness
[6:48 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: yes because you don't want to just be someone
[6:49 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: it would be very sad
[6:49 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: you want some things to overcome being just someone with some things
[6:49 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: in the process of being itself becoming someone that is you
[6:50 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: lol this dialect is funny
[6:50 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: it's pretty solid but I want to work on the consistency of my definitions
[6:51 AM] Occultare: it is complicated
[6:51 AM] Occultare: :smile:
[6:51 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: yeah well it got a lot easier when I got to apply it to you
[6:51 AM] Occultare: that's good
[6:53 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: in there I overcame being someone not having it as easy I became someone more able of having it as easy and overcame being someone not able to have it as easy but more able to do other things by choice than writing these things
[6:54 AM] LizardCalledLazarus: so I am now someone with these some things that I can choose to not be of again like if it gets too creepy to myself I can be aware of some things about myself(someone) to be overcome by becoming of someone else
