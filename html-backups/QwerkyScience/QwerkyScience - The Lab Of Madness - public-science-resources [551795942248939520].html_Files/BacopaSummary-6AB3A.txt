MOST EVERYTHING BELOW IS SPECIFIC TO BACOPA EXTRACT CONTAINING BACOSIDES AND NOT JUST THE PLANT ITSELF.


•Constituents include: Brahmine, Nicotine, Herpestine, D-Mannitol, apigenin, hersaponin,monnierasides 1-3, cucurbitacins, bacosides, and plantainoside.
•The main active constituents are the bacosides. 4 of which make up bacoside A.
•There are 5 major bacosides in bacopa, bacoside A3, bacopaside II, bacopaside X, and bacopasaponin C
•Bacoside A is responsible for most of bacopa's cognitive effects.
•Bacoside A increases levels of glutathione, vit. c, vit. e, and vit. a. Aswell as glutathione.
•Bacoside A's antioxidant/neuroprotective properties are due to increasing activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. 
•Bacopa shows use in parkinsons syndrome due to its reduction in alpha-synuclein protein aggregation, which leads to dopamine neuron degeneration.
•Bacopa has monoamine modulation/potentiation, specifically 5-HT and DA, allowing the potential to restore age-induced reduction in these.
•Bacopa is helpful in normalizing issues with hyper-excitability, locomotor activity, and social exploration. Atleast in rat models with sodium valproate induced autism.
•Bacopa seems to *significantly* increase nerve growth factor and tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the hippocampus, comparable to that of L-Deprenyl(Selegeline). Aswell as upregulation of tryptophan hydroxylase.
•Bacopa inhibited central nervous system dopamine depletion by 33% when induced by a pesticide that causes DA depletion by inducing oxidative stress.
•While Bacopa normalizes 5-HT and DA, it seems to have no effect in normalizing noradrenaline.
•In a chronic stress model, Bacopa did seem to elevate levels of noradrenaline as well as DA and 5-HT.
•Bacopa upregulates SERT expression
•Bacopa also elicited high increases in TPH2 and SERT mRNA levels, which returned to baseline 24 days after ending bacopa administration.
•Bacopa reduced memory impairment caused by a 5-HT3a agonist.
•Bacopa has shown to reverse benzodiazepine-induced amnesia in mice at 120mg/kg. (around 7.5 grams in an average human)
•Bacopa methanol extract protects against opioid induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Other actions studied seem to be listed as ehtanol extracted bacopa.
•Bacoside A blocks the leakage of Creatine Kinase into the blood from cigarette smoke exposure. Aswell as reversing the level of CK variations in the blood. CK and variations are considered to be markers for a diagnosis of cardiac and cerebral damage.
•Bacoside A inhibits the mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain induced by cigaratte smoke.
•Bacopa increases cerebreal blood flow.
•Bacopa causes a significant upregulation in the synthesis of serotonin.
•Bacopa directly inhibits CYP enzymes CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and weak inhibition of CYP2D6. It reduces the catalytic activities of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.
•Bacopa upregulates the expression of subunit GluR2 of AMPA receptors.
•Bacopa modulates NMDA receptor functions, leading to balancing the neurotransmitter level.
•Bacopa increases BDNF by stimulating TrkB signaling aswell as promotes neurogenesis.
•Bacopa upregulates D1 and D2.
•Bacopa exhibits agonistic effects at CB1
•Bacopa antagonizes 5-HT2A, 5-HT6, and possibly D1
•Bacopa enhances acetlycholine synthesis.
•Reductions in BDNF, AKT, and CREB are reversed by Bacopa, indicating sigma-1 activation.
