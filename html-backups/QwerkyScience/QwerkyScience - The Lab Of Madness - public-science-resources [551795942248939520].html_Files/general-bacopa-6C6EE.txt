•Constituents include: Brahmine, Nicotine, Herpestine, D-Mannitol, apigenin, hersaponin,monnierasides 1-3, cucurbitacins, bacosides, and plantainoside.
•Bacoside A is responsible for most of bacopa's cognitive effects.
•Bacoside A increases levels of glutathione, vit. c, vit. e, and vit. a.
•Bacoside A's antioxidant/neuroprotective properties are due to increasing activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. 
•Bacopa shows use in parkinsons syndrome due to its reduction in alpha-synuclein protein aggregation, which leads to dopamine neuron degeneration.
•Bacopa has monoamine potentiation, specifically 5-HT and DA, allowing the potential to restore age-induced reduction in these.
•Bacopa is helpful in normalizing issues with hyper-excitability, locomotor activity, and social exploration. Atleast in rat models with sodium valproate induced autism.
•Bacopa seems to *significantly* increase nerve growth factor and tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the hippocampus, comparable to that of L-Deprenyl(Selegeline). Aswell as upregulation of tryptophan hydroxylase.
•Bacopa inhibited central nervous system dopamine depletion by 33% when induced by a pesticide that causes DA depletion by inducing oxidative stress.
•While Bacopa normalizes 5-HT and DA, it seems to have no effect in normalizing noradrenaline.
•In a chronic stress model, Bacopa did seem to elevate levels of noradrenaline as well as DA and 5-HT.
•Bacopa upregulates SERT expression
•Bacopa also elicited high increases in TPH2 and SERT mRNA levels, which returned to baseline 24 days after ending bacopa administration.
•Bacopa reduced memory impairment caused by a 5-HT3a agonist, possibly making it a 5-HT3a antagonist.
•Bacopa has shown to reverse benzodiazepine-induced amnesia.
