Here is a detailed summary of the key points in this article:

Introduction

- The article presents a theory called "Neural Annealing" which aims to unify different concepts in neuroscience like the Entropic Brain, Free Energy Principle, Connectome-Specific Harmonic Waves, and the Symmetry Theory of Valence. 

- It argues traditional neuroscience has focused on cataloging discrete facts about the brain rather than understanding its underlying computational principles and algorithms. The "new neuroscience" seeks to reverse engineer the core organizing principles of the brain as a self-organizing system.

Annealing Metaphors

- Annealing involves heating a metal, letting its microstructure reach equilibrium, then cooling it slowly so new patterns can form. This releases internal stresses and restores plasticity.

- Psychedelics may work similarly by adding neural excitation that disrupts patterns, pushing the brain into a more malleable state where it can reorganize into new equilibria as the drug effects fade. This recurring cycle of "perturbation -> disintegration -> search -> annealing" allows the brain to update itself.

- Meditation can also be seen as a "reheating" process where the brain enters a plastic neutral state, releases stresses, and recrystallizes into a more balanced configuration through repeated annealing.

Connecting FEP, CSHW, EBH/REBUS 

- The article argues Neural Annealing unifies Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle (FEP), Selen Atasoy's Connectome-Specific Harmonic Waves (CSHW), and Robin Carhart-Harris's Entropic Brain Hypothesis (EBH)/REBUS model.

- FEP views the brain as minimizing surprise by matching top-down predictions with bottom-up stimuli. CSHW shows the brain has natural resonant frequencies. EBH describes increased neural entropy disrupting patterns.

How Meditation Works

- Meditation builds up "semantically neutral" energy by increasing sensory input and attenuating top-down predictive models. This energy accumulates in natural brain harmonics, pushing the brain into a malleable state where stresses can be released and beneficial new patterns formed during annealing.

- This harmonically-targeted annealing makes the brain more unified, anti-fragile, less distorted by intentionality, and structurally optimized. It also retunes the brain's default state toward resonance, boosting pleasure.

The Nature of Trauma 

- Trauma results when significant negative events push the brain into high-energy states filled with trauma patterns, and these anneal into very durable configurations that persist as PTSD.

- To prevent uncontrolled propagation of damaging state changes, the brain may disrupt communication between regions by weakening connectome-wide harmonic waves and putting regions into non-interacting frequencies. 

Love and Annealing

- Most annealing happens "pointed at" some object/event/idea that triggered it. Falling in love can be seen as annealing to the felt-sense of another person.

- Social annealing happens when groups undergo disintegration/annealing together, creating cohesion. Rhythmic music, dance, and some drugs enable social annealing on demand.

- Semantically "neutral" annealing without intentional focus may be healthiest, done via meditation, music, or psychedelics. It retunes the brain's harmonics toward flow states.

Psychedelics 

- Psychedelics massively increase "semantically neutral" energy by disabling or overloading the brain's normal energy regulation. This allows more exploration and beneficial annealing.

- Different psychedelics likely have specific energy disruption "flavors" targeting certain parts of the brain's harmonic spectrum more than others.

Conclusion

- Neural Annealing elegantly unifies physical, computational, and energetic neuroscience principles toward understanding the brain as a self-organizing system.

- Better understanding of emotional updating, mental illness, meditation and psychedelics could lead to substantially improved psychological health.
