super mod guidelines:
in tarminal channel you see
-activity log, include message edits  :  ) (supermods excluded ) 
-/inviter x (for who invited who)
-member joins

-/accounts(for member list, can be exported to txt)

things to know:
-any message with 
"buy" + link
from this vendor
from vendor
will be autodeleted (admin/super mod/bots excluded) 
servers invite links (only "online" role, other rules excluded) 

-new members get stuck in welcome channel, with "new comer" role, they choose "online" role , and directly they lost ability to see that channel instead pushed to the server
-choosing roles are 3 option, because some bots was smart enough to click normal check mark.

-when you make invite link, use private society channel (or new comers will see nothing until they click it)


-admin

ideas:
-auto deleted messages older then 30days in casual channel exclude pinned
reason: headnotes like vegan modle of psychpathy.
