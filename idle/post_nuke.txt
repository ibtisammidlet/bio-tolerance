quate(blank, "This channel is only for anemoi. Limited roles can only see burg and forum categories")
good idea pitch, i knowed i can depande on you
if you keep doing this
making channel about who come first who come next
highly knowleadged biohackers will be kept in animio
so we can make the conept attacking conversation there, where we deassemblify the thought stream, and cheamical cascade
with no noob intrept us which stupid questions 
then the next channel is people from noot3.0 
and the next to it is for random people from disboard
aniomio see only thier channel 
what ever the role of the people in the noot3.0 channle is, they will see theier channel and animio
where disboard randomes see thiers and noot3.0 one
this force each level of knowleadge to being exposed to just level above it a bit
which he can understand
