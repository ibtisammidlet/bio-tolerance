## Not updated anymore!
I don't have time and motivation to work on SB. It has many problems which are very hard to fix. Server Backuper is officially finished. No new features are expected to land. Bugs will still be fixed.
I seriously recommend you to use a bot like Wick or Lavan instead. They are way better than SB. If you still need SB, use the v2.

## ➲ What does it do?

Server Backuper protects your server from nukers and crash-bots.

## ➲ Why Server Backuper? There are lots of other bots.

Server Backuper uses its unique reputation system, which alerts about raids and doesn't alert about good moderation actions (like punishing raiders).

## ➲ Is it safe?

Yes! I will never put you a virus or something like that. If you are so worried, view the code and decide yourself!

## ➲ How do I get support?

Open an issue or join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/xzpcXYz6yK)!

## ➲ I don't have resources to run it myself!

Invite [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=797792817983389726&permissions=19584&scope=bot) bot, which is run by me!
